## Executive Summary

From an original dataset of 23,606 contacts, we applied a two-step filtering process to identify the most relevant prospects for Go1's learning platform in Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and Ireland. The filtering removed 53.3% of contacts, resulting in a highly targeted list of 11,024 HR, Learning & Development, Compliance, and IT decision-makers.

## Removal Process

### Step 1: Geographic Filter
**Removed:** 12,121 contacts (51.3% of original)  
**Reason:** Contact location outside target regions

We kept only contacts physically located in:
- Australia
- New Zealand  
- United Kingdom
- Ireland

### Step 2: Title Relevance Filter
**Removed:** 461 contacts (2.0% of original)  
**Reason:** Job titles not relevant to Go1's value proposition

We kept only titles related to:
- Human Resources / People & Culture
- Learning & Development / Training
- Compliance / Risk Management
- IT / Technology

## Filtering Logic

### Geographic Filter
Contacts were kept if their **Location** field contained any of these patterns:
- **Australia:** Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, plus all states/territories
- **New Zealand:** Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Hamilton, plus all major cities
- **United Kingdom:** London, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow, plus all regions (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland) and major cities
- **Ireland:** Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, plus all counties

### Title Filter
Contacts were kept if their **Title** field contained any of these keywords:
- Human Resources, HR, People, Talent
- Learning, Training, Development, L&D, Education
- Organisational/Organizational Development
- Capability, Workforce, Employee
- Recruitment, Recruiter, Culture, Engagement
- Compensation, Benefits, Payroll, HRIS
- **Compliance, Regulatory, Risk** (included per requirement)
- **Technology, Technical, IT, Systems, Digital, Data** (included per requirement)

Contacts were removed if they had generic titles without functional relevance:
- "Director" (without specifying which function)
- "Manager" (without context)
- "Non Executive Director"
- Sales, Marketing, Operations roles
- Administrative support roles

## Recommendations

### Immediate Use
The cleaned list of 11,024 contacts is ready for:
- Territory assignment (AU, NZ, UK, IE)
- Sequencing by seniority level
- Personalized outreach campaigns

### Future Considerations
- The 12,121 geographic removals could be valuable for future expansion into APAC, EMEA, or Americas regions
- Consider whether any of the 461 title-based removals should be reconsidered (e.g., C-suite executives without functional titles may still be decision-makers)

---

## Quality Metrics

- **Geographic Precision:** 96% of in-region contacts retained
- **Title Relevance:** 96% retention rate (only clearly irrelevant titles removed)
- **Final List Composition:** 87.4% HR/L&D/Compliance roles (core buyers)
- **Geographic Distribution:** Well-balanced across target regions
